          Teddy has a vast amount of interests and hobbies, bordering on the adage, "Jack of all trades master of none." However, they all center around one thing, people; engaging with people--IT and web development--, entertaining people--art of writing, acting, photography, & music--, helping people--mental health, coaching, & training. His focus has always been towards a single goal, improvement. Whether it be just the improvement of one's mood, their day or their life, he believes there is always a way to improve.

            Teddy has written many things, such as stories, poems and songs. For him, writing has always been a sort of release or a means to quell the storm within, allowing for the expression of complex emotion in a way that simply stating cannot convey. Writing breathes life into thought and dreams, and up until recently was the means he had to illustrate the ever growing world of his imagination. <hr/> Below is a poetic taste.
